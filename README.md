# ASE-Capstone

## Project Description

A 2D videogame where the player interacts with the world through a terminal.


## Problem Domain

Many people have little to no experience with terminals on a computer, but may find just jumping in to be too difficult a task. Therefore, having a game where you use a terminal as a controller would give the user some basics of how a terminal works and some instant feedback through the visuals of the game.
